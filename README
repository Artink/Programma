Programma is the typeface I use when programming and teaching about
programming. Programma is a sans serif monospace typeface.

Programma is eclectic. It borrows ideas from Microgramma, Courier, Palatino,
Twentieth Century, and others. Programma is not suitable for most purposes,
but it is pretty good at representing computer programs.

Programma is still being tinkered with, but it is mostly done.

Daley was inspired by Machine and Susan Kare's Chicago.

Programma and Daley are in the Public Domain. You are free to use it. But if you
ask if I will give you a license, the answer will be "absolutely not".
