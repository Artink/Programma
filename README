Programma is the typeface I use when programming and teaching about
programming. Programma is a sans serif monospace typeface.

Programma is eclectic. It borrows ideas from Microgramma, Inconsolata, Courier,
Palatino, Twentieth Century, and others. Programma is not suitable for most
purposes, but it is pretty good at representing computer programs.

Programma is still being tinkered with.

Daley was inspired by Machine and Susan Kare's Chicago.
